# AI Task Completion System

## Overview

The AI Task Completion System automatically processes tasks marked as `ai` by leveraging existing company documents, artifacts from previously completed tasks, and system context. This allows the AI to complete tasks without manual intervention when sufficient context is available.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DataService Extensions** (`/src/lib/data-service.ts`)
   - `getCompletedTasksWithArtifacts()` - Retrieves completed tasks with their documents and artifacts
   - `getAITaskContext()` - Aggregates all available context for AI task processing

2. **AI Task Completion API** (`/src/app/api/ai-task-completion/route.ts`)
   - `POST` - Processes and completes AI tasks using available context
   - `GET` - Checks AI readiness and provides resource assessment

3. **UI Component** (`/src/components/AITaskCompletion.tsx`)
   - Shows AI readiness score and available resources
   - Provides one-click AI task completion
   - Displays completion results and status

### How It Works

1. **Context Collection**: The system gathers all available context including:
   - Company information (name, description, website)
   - Previously completed tasks and their outputs
   - Uploaded documents from all tasks
   - Generated artifacts (documents, reports, etc.)

2. **Readiness Assessment**: Before attempting completion, the system evaluates:
   - Number of available documents
   - Number of artifacts from completed tasks
   - Number of completed tasks to reference
   - Calculates a readiness score (0-100%)

3. **AI Processing**: When triggered, the AI:
   - Analyzes the task requirements
   - Uses all available context and previous outputs
   - Generates a comprehensive response
   - Creates artifacts if needed (wrapped in `<artifact>` tags)

4. **Automatic Completion**: If the AI response indicates successful completion:
   - Task status is updated to 'completed'
   - Dependencies are automatically updated
   - Chat history is updated with the AI response

## Usage

### For AI Tasks

1. Navigate to any task marked with the `ai` tag
2. The AI Task Completion component will appear above the chat interface
3. Review the readiness score and available resources
4. Click "Complete Task with AI" to trigger automatic processing
5. Monitor the progress and review the results

### Readiness Scoring

- **80-100%**: Excellent - Rich context with documents, artifacts, and completed tasks
- **60-79%**: Good - Sufficient context for reliable completion
- **40-59%**: Fair - Limited context, results may vary
- **0-39%**: Limited - Insufficient context for reliable completion

### Resource Types

- **Documents**: Files uploaded during previous task interactions
- **Artifacts**: Generated documents, reports, and structured outputs from completed tasks
- **Completed Tasks**: Previously finished tasks that provide context and reference material

## API Endpoints

### Check AI Readiness
```http
GET /api/ai-task-completion?taskId={taskId}&companyId={companyId}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "canComplete": true,
  "readinessScore": 85,
  "availableResources": {
    "documents": 12,
    "artifacts": 8,
    "completedTasks": 15
  },
  "recommendations": ["AI can complete this task using available company data"]
}
```

### Complete AI Task
```http
POST /api/ai-task-completion
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "taskId": "task-id",
  "companyId": "company-id"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "taskCompleted": true,
  "aiResponse": "Generated response text...",
  "documentsUsed": 12,
  "artifactsUsed": 8,
  "completedTasksReferenced": 15
}
```

## Integration Points

### Database Collections

- `companyTasks` - Task definitions and status
- `taskChats/{taskId}/messages` - Chat history containing documents and artifacts
- `companies` - Company information used for context

### Dependencies

The system integrates with existing functionality:
- Task status updates trigger dependency resolution
- Chat system stores AI-generated responses
- Document handling preserves uploaded files
- Artifact parsing extracts generated content

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Automatically completes routine AI tasks without manual intervention
2. **Consistency**: Uses established company data and previous outputs for reliable results
3. **Context Awareness**: Leverages all available information for informed task completion
4. **Scalability**: Handles multiple tasks simultaneously using existing resources
5. **Transparency**: Provides clear visibility into resources used and completion status

## Best Practices

1. **Task Design**: Ensure AI tasks have clear, specific requirements
2. **Context Building**: Complete manual tasks first to build rich context for AI tasks
3. **Review Results**: Always review AI-generated outputs for accuracy
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Use AI suggestions to refine task definitions and prompts

## Limitations

- Requires existing completed tasks or documents for optimal performance
- AI quality depends on the quality and relevance of available context
- Complex tasks may still require human review and refinement
- Network connectivity required for AI processing
