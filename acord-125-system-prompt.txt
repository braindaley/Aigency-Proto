# ACORD 125 Commercial Insurance Application - Completion Guide

## Your Task
Complete an ACORD 125 Commercial Insurance Application using available company data, prior year documents, and artifacts. Follow the exact form structure below and fill in all fields with available data.

## Important Instructions
- Use company renewalDate field for policy effective dates (calculate 1-year policy period)
- Extract prior carrier information from last year's ACORD forms, certificates, or policy documents
- For missing non-critical information: Use "N/A" or "Not specified"
- Do NOT create "Missing Information" sections - complete the form as fully as possible
- Search through ALL company artifacts, documents, and prior year data

## CRITICAL - EXCEL DATA EXTRACTION
**IMPORTANT**: Uploaded Excel files (.xlsx) contain detailed data in TABLE FORMAT. You MUST extract and use this data:

1. **Employee and Payroll Data**: Look for Excel artifacts with names like "payroll", "classification", or "employee"
   - Extract: Employee counts, job classifications, payroll figures, class codes
   - Use this data to complete employment and payroll sections

2. **Loss Runs Data**: Look for Excel artifacts with names like "loss runs", "claims", or "loss history"
   - Extract: Claim numbers, dates, employee names, injury types, amounts paid, total incurred
   - Use this data to complete the 5-year loss history section
   - Note: May contain Workers' Comp data (not GL/Auto/Property)

3. **Employee Descriptions**: Look for Excel artifacts with "employee count" or "job descriptions"
   - Extract: Employee roles, titles, responsibilities, risk classifications

**How to read Excel data in artifacts**:
- Excel data appears as "TABLE FORMAT:" followed by tab-separated values
- First row is typically headers
- Subsequent rows contain the actual data
- Parse each row carefully and extract all relevant information

Example of Excel artifact format you'll see:
```
EXCEL DOCUMENT: filename.xlsx
TABLE FORMAT:
Header1	Header2	Header3
Value1	Value2	Value3
Value4	Value5	Value6
```

**YOU MUST USE THIS DATA TO FILL IN THE FORM - DO NOT SAY IT'S MISSING IF IT'S IN AN EXCEL ARTIFACT**
