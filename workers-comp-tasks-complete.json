Each packet included ACORD 125, ACORD 130, loss runs, narrative, and coverage suggestions.\n\n## Your Task\n1. **Review the prior task's submissions** to identify all carriers that received emails\n2. **Generate a professional follow-up email for EACH of those carriers**\n3. Use the same carrier names and email addresses from the original submissions\n4. Reference the original submission and politely request:\n   - Confirmation of receipt\n   - Expected timeline for quote response  \n   - Any additional information needed\n   - Underwriter contact information if not already known\n\n## Email Requirements\n- **CRITICAL**: Write as a professional insurance broker emailing an underwriter\n- DO NOT include ANY task details, metadata, system information, or internal references\n- DO NOT mention \"Task 11\", \"Task 13\", \"artifacts\", \"workflow\", or similar\n- DO NOT include phrases like \"based on task details\" or \"according to the system\"\n- The email should read as a natural business correspondence from broker to underwriter\n- Professional and courteous insurance industry tone\n- Reference the original submission date and included documents\n- Keep it brief (3-4 short paragraphs)\n- Include specific call-to-action\n- Personalize for each carrier\n- **MUST match the exact number and names of carriers from the prior task**\n\n## CRITICAL: Multi-Artifact Output Format\n\nYou MUST create a SEPARATE email artifact for EACH carrier that received the original submission. Use this exact format:\n\n```\n<artifacts>\n<artifact id=\"[carrier-slug]-follow-up-email\" name=\"Follow-up: [Carrier Name]\" type=\"email\">\nSubject: Follow-up: Workers' Compensation Submission for [Company Name]\n\nDear [Carrier/Underwriter Name],\n\nI wanted to follow up on the Workers' Compensation submission we sent for [Company Name] on [Date]. The submission included:\n\n- ACORD 125 Commercial Insurance Application\n- ACORD 130 Workers' Compensation Application  \n- 5-year loss runs\n- Risk narrative\n- Coverage recommendations\n\nCould you please confirm receipt and provide an estimated timeline for your quote response? If you need any additional information or clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n[Agent Name]\n[Agency Name]\n[Phone]\n[Email]\n</artifact>\n\n<artifact id=\"[next-carrier-slug]-follow-up-email\" name=\"Follow-up: [Next Carrier Name]\" type=\"email\">\n[Next carrier's follow-up email]\n</artifact>\n</artifacts>\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n- **CRITICAL**: Look ONLY at Task 11 \"Draft custom marketing emails\" artifacts for the carrier list\n- Count the exact number of carriers in Task 11 and create ONLY that many follow-up emails\n- Review the prior task's marketing emails FIRST to get the exact list of carriers\n- Generate one <artifact> for EACH carrier from the prior task's submissions\n- Use carrier name in lowercase with hyphens for the artifact ID (e.g., \"starr-follow-up-email\", \"travelers-follow-up-email\")\n- Match the artifact ID format from the original emails: if the original was \"starr-email\", the follow-up should be \"starr-follow-up-email\"\n- Personalize each email based on the carrier\n- Keep consistent professional tone across all emails\n- All artifacts must be within a single <artifacts> wrapper\n- **The number of follow-up emails MUST equal the number of original submissions**",
