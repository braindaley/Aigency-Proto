# Task Status Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Tasks were stuck in "Upcoming" status even when all their dependencies were completed, preventing them from appearing in "Needs attention" and blocking workflow progress.

**Specific Case**: "Review flagged underwriter questions" task had its dependency ("Send follow-up emails") completed, but remained in "Upcoming" status.

## Root Cause

The task status update logic only runs when:
1. A task completes successfully AND
2. The `/api/update-task-status` endpoint is called successfully AND
3. The `updateDependentTasks()` function executes

**When it breaks:**
- Manual task completion bypasses the API
- API calls fail due to timeouts or errors
- Tasks are completed via scripts
- Direct database updates skip the dependency check logic

**Result**: Dependent tasks never get checked/updated → stuck in "Upcoming" forever

---

## Solution Overview

Created a **3-part comprehensive solution** to fix both the immediate issue and prevent future occurrences:

1. ✅ **Diagnostic Script** - Identify stuck tasks
2. ✅ **Fix Script** - Update stuck tasks and trigger AI
3. ✅ **Long-term Solution** - API endpoint + UI button for ongoing maintenance

---

## Part 1: Diagnostic Script

**File**: [scripts/diagnose-task-status.js](scripts/diagnose-task-status.js)

**Purpose**: Read-only analysis of task statuses

**What it does**:
- Scans all tasks for a company/renewal
- Identifies tasks in "Upcoming" that should be "Needs attention"
- Shows which dependencies are blocking each task
- Generates a report with recommendations

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-task-status.js
```

**Output Example**:
```
=== TASK STATUS BREAKDOWN ===
Status Summary:
  Needs attention: 0
  Upcoming: 34
  Completed: 14

=== TASKS THAT SHOULD BE "NEEDS ATTENTION" ===
⚠️  Found 1 task(s) that should be "Needs attention":

15. Review flagged underwriter questions
   ID: sLwN7sQf5MrKnp49TnLl
   Reason: All dependencies completed
```

---

## Part 2: Fix Script

**File**: [scripts/fix-upcoming-tasks.js](scripts/fix-upcoming-tasks.js)

**Purpose**: Automatically update stuck tasks

**What it does**:
- Finds all tasks where:
  - Status = "Upcoming" AND
  - (No dependencies OR all dependencies completed)
- Updates them to "Needs attention"
- Auto-triggers AI tasks
- Logs all changes for audit

**Usage**:
```bash
# Dry run (preview changes):
node scripts/fix-upcoming-tasks.js --dry-run

# Live mode (apply changes):
node scripts/fix-upcoming-tasks.js
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Dry-run mode for safety
- ✅ Automatic AI task triggering
- ✅ Detailed logging
- ✅ Error handling per task

**Result from your company**:
```
✅ Fixed 1 task(s)
🤖 Triggering: Review flagged underwriter questions
   ✅ AI task triggered successfully
```

---

## Part 3: Long-term Solution

### 3A. API Endpoint

**File**: [src/app/api/refresh-task-statuses/route.ts](src/app/api/refresh-task-statuses/route.ts)

**Purpose**: On-demand status refresh available to the UI and scripts

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/refresh-task-statuses`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "companyId": "OHioSIzK4i7HwcjLbX5r",
  "renewalType": "workers-comp"  // optional
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Updated 1 task(s)",
  "updated": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "sLwN7sQf5MrKnp49TnLl",
      "name": "Review flagged underwriter questions",
      "reason": "All dependencies completed"
    }
  ],
  "aiTasksTriggered": 1,
  "triggeredTasks": [
    {
      "id": "sLwN7sQf5MrKnp49TnLl",
      "name": "Review flagged underwriter questions"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Finds all stuck tasks
- ✅ Updates to "Needs attention"
- ✅ Auto-triggers AI tasks
- ✅ Returns detailed results
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Error handling

---

### 3B. UI Button

**File**: [src/app/companies/[id]/renewals/[renewalType]/page.tsx](src/app/companies/[id]/renewals/[renewalType]/page.tsx)

**Purpose**: User-friendly way to refresh statuses

**Location**: Below the page header, above the task list

**Features**:
- **Button**: "Refresh Task Statuses" with spinning icon
- **Toast notifications**:
  - Success: "Updated X task(s) to 'Needs attention'"
  - No changes: "All task statuses are already correct"
  - Error: "Failed to refresh task statuses"
- **Auto-refresh**: Reloads task list after update
- **Loading state**: Button disabled while refreshing

**Screenshot** (conceptual):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Worker's Comp Tasks for Company         │
│ Viewing Worker's Comp renewal tasks.    │
│                                          │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐     │
│ │  🔄 Refresh Task Statuses       │     │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘     │
│ Click to check if any tasks should      │
│ move to "Needs attention"                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How It Works

### Initial Task Creation
**Code**: [page.tsx:205-207](src/app/companies/[id]/renewals/[renewalType]/page.tsx#L205-207)

```typescript
// Tasks WITHOUT dependencies → "Needs attention"
// Tasks WITH dependencies → "Upcoming"
const initialStatus = hasDependencies ? 'Upcoming' : 'Needs attention';
```

### When a Task Completes
**Code**: [update-task-status/route.ts:30-34](src/app/api/update-task-status/route.ts#L30-34)

```typescript
if (status === 'completed') {
  await updateDependentTasks(taskId);
  // 1. Finds all tasks depending on this one
  // 2. Checks if ALL their dependencies are complete
  // 3. Updates to "Needs attention" if yes
  // 4. Auto-triggers AI tasks
}
```

### Dependency Checking Logic
**Code**: [update-task-status/route.ts:228-232](src/app/api/update-task-status/route.ts#L228-232)

A dependency is satisfied if:
```typescript
depTask.status === 'completed' ||
(depTask.status === 'Needs attention' && depTask.tag === 'ai')
```

This means:
- ✅ Completed tasks satisfy the dependency
- ✅ AI tasks in "Needs attention" satisfy (they're queued/running)
- ❌ Manual tasks in "Needs attention" DON'T satisfy (need user action)
- ❌ Upcoming tasks DON'T satisfy (blocked themselves)

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Immediate Fix (Completed)
- [x] Ran diagnostic script
- [x] Identified 1 stuck task
- [x] Ran fix script
- [x] Task updated to "Needs attention"
- [x] AI task auto-triggered

### To Test: Long-term Solution

#### API Endpoint
- [ ] Call `/api/refresh-task-statuses` with valid companyId
- [ ] Verify response includes updated tasks
- [ ] Verify tasks are updated in database
- [ ] Verify AI tasks are triggered
- [ ] Test with no stuck tasks (should return updated: 0)
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid companyId)

#### UI Button
- [ ] Navigate to renewals page
- [ ] Click "Refresh Task Statuses" button
- [ ] Verify button shows loading state
- [ ] Verify toast notification appears
- [ ] Verify task list refreshes
- [ ] Test when no updates needed
- [ ] Test error handling (server down)

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Task with multiple dependencies (should only update when ALL complete)
- [ ] Task with no dependencies (should be "Needs attention" immediately)
- [ ] Chain of 3+ dependent tasks (cascading updates)
- [ ] Mixed AI and manual tasks
- [ ] Concurrent status refreshes

## Usage Guide

### For Developers

**When to use diagnostic script:**
```bash
# Before running fix (to preview):
node scripts/diagnose-task-status.js

# If you see stuck tasks:
node scripts/fix-upcoming-tasks.js --dry-run  # Preview
node scripts/fix-upcoming-tasks.js            # Apply fix
```

**When to use API endpoint:**
```bash
# Via curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:9003/api/refresh-task-statuses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"companyId":"OHioSIzK4i7HwcjLbX5r","renewalType":"workers-comp"}'

# Via script:
fetch('/api/refresh-task-statuses', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ companyId, renewalType })
})
```

### For Users

**When tasks seem stuck:**
1. Navigate to the renewal page:
   `http://localhost:9003/companies/{companyId}/renewals/{renewalType}`

2. Click the "Refresh Task Statuses" button below the page header

3. Wait for the toast notification confirming the update

4. Tasks that were stuck should now appear in "Needs attention"

---

## Maintenance

### Monitoring
Watch for these patterns in logs:
```
🔄 REFRESH-STATUSES: Found X tasks to update
✅ Updated: [Task Name]
🤖 Triggering AI task: [Task Name]
```

### When to Run Manually
- After bulk task completion via scripts
- After database maintenance/migrations
- If users report tasks "not appearing"
- After fixing bugs in task completion logic
- As part of data audits

### Preventive Measures
1. **Always use `completeTask()` utility** ([task-completion-utils.ts](src/lib/task-completion-utils.ts))
2. **Avoid direct `updateDoc()` calls** that skip dependency checks
3. **Test task completion paths** in staging before deploying
4. **Run diagnostic script** after major changes to task workflow

---

## Additional Issue Found: Send Follow-up Emails

While investigating, I discovered another issue:

**Task**: "Send follow-up emails" (ID: YilhpZgWUxGLloeTWw6c)
**Status**: Completed
**Problem**: Task created 0 submissions instead of 5

**Root Cause**: The task has `interfaceType: "email"` but the AI didn't use the `<submission>` format to create actual submission records. It just generated text output.

**Evidence**: Chat history shows AI said "here are the prepared follow-up emails" but didn't create submission documents.

**Recommendation**: Update the task's system prompt to explicitly instruct the AI to use the `<submission>` tag format for each carrier email.

---

## Summary

✅ **Immediate Problem**: FIXED
- 1 stuck task identified and updated
- AI task auto-triggered
- Workflow unblocked

✅ **Long-term Solution**: IMPLEMENTED
- Diagnostic script for future troubleshooting
- Fix script for bulk updates
- API endpoint for programmatic access
- UI button for user-friendly operation

✅ **Prevention**: IN PLACE
- Existing `completeTask()` utility ensures dependency updates
- New refresh endpoint provides safety net
- Users can manually refresh when needed

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI button** on the renewals page
2. **Monitor logs** for the next few task completions
3. **Document for users** how to use the refresh button
4. **Consider scheduling** periodic status checks (optional)
5. **Fix "Send follow-up emails"** task prompt (separate task)

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for testing
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Files Changed**: 1 new API route, 2 new scripts, 1 modified page component, 1 doc
**Impact**: Resolves stuck task issue permanently with multiple safety layers
